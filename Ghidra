Decompiler
-----------
1. Mark all occurences of a symbol - click on the middle button in the mouse on this symbol
2. Change data to a different type, for example change byte to char - go to the disassembly and change it by right click on the data operand -> Convert -> Char sequence or whatever.
3. Highlight disassembly instructions that matches the decompiled lines - select the decompiled lines.
4. Highlight decompiled lines that matches the disassembly instructions - select the disassembly instructions.

What I need in Ghidra
----------------------
Here is a list of things that I need that Ghidra will have (by a core functionality or plugins) that I have in IDA:
1. show xrefs to a variable in the decompiler window
2. navigate to functions more faster
In my free time I will try to find tools/ways to implement these features
