Fuzzing
--------
Fuzzing with regular afl-fuzz relies on the binary being compiled with afl-clang, which adds an instrumentation to the binary - 
a "report command" for each code block to know that it entered to that block.
DON'T even try to fuzz in this way a binary that is not compiled with afl-clang.

afl-fuzz -i ./input/ -o ./output/ -- ./program @@

The "@@" will be replaced each time with the fuzzing input file.

Fuzzing with QEMU
------------------
This method is good for black box fuzzing, where you still able to run the binary with QEMU.
Fuzzing with QEMU relies on afl-qemu-trace, which emulates a binary and trace all addresses
So the fuzzer will know how many code blocks are covered using the trace log

#one time phase:
git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus
cd AFLplusplus
make distrib
cd qemu_mode
CPU_TARGET=arm ./build_qemu_support.sh
cd ../
sudo make install

#the fuzzing cmd:
cd ~/fuzz_sample
afl-fuzz -Q -i ./input/ -o ./output/ -- /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/lib/ld-linux.so.3 --library-path /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/lib:./ ./program @@

Fuzzing with unicornafl
------------------------
This method is good for black box firmwares, where you can't even run the binary because its not a linux program.
Also, it might be useful for binaries that access IO and stuff that are hard to emulate and you rather to just hook them up.
Unicorn is actually built on top of QEMU, the two great things about it is that it can emulate a blob of binary and not just a fully linked ELF. Also it can place hooks in a very convenient way.

afl-fuzz -U -m none -i ./input/ -o ./output/ -- ./program @@

Debugging failing fuzzing
--------------------------
You can set the env var AFL_DEBUG_CHILD_OUTPUT=1 so that the output of the fuzzed program will be printed to the screen.
This way you can debug by print the problem and see what went wrong

Fuzzing with frida mode
------------------------
Add " -O" flag to afl-fuzz (compiling afl-fuzz with "make distrib" will also compile frida-mode)
Also, checkout Scripting.md:
https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/frida_mode/Scripting.md
There are some cool hooks and tweaks that can be made.

Fuzzing shared libraries
-------------------------
You can fuzz a shared libraries using frida mode and set AFL_INST_LIBS=1.
For other possibilities:
https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/docs/fuzzing_binary-only_targets.md#shared-libraries

Continue to run after logging out
---------------------------------
If you run it in a server, you probably want to continue the running after logging out from the server.
You can do it by running the fuzzer from tmux or screen
