The emulator
---------------
1. If the emulator can't start - make sure it has enough RAM
2. If you close the emulator by clicking on X - it will mess up the emulator
3. If the emulator doesn't start because you brutally exited - you can run a "cold boot" from the AVD manager and it will solve it.

Permissions
-------------
1. In order to add a permissions you need to add a line to AndroidManifest.xml (in /app/manifests):
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
  You can search through the permissions by using the auto-completion of Android Studio (Ctrl+Space)
2. All of the networking permissions are included in android.permission.INTERNET

Threads
--------
1. Every IO action needs to be done in a thread.
For example:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/43775284
2. Executing blocking actions in a threwad might be tricky to debug - you might think that the thread just ended without doing anything,
but its still wait for something.
3. List the threads by using Android Studio's Profiler:

Networking
------------
1. Connecting to an IP might be tricky, because its a blocking action that happen
2. The network of the emulator is described here:

Where the host IP is 10.0.2.2 and the device IP is 10.0.2.15
