sudo apt install qemu-user 

# run ARM binary 
qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/  main 

# In order to run ELF with couple of libraries: 
qemu-arm /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 --library-path "/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib:../:../../../../openssl" ./sample 
Note that its better to use the ld-linux of the target program (if its from a firmware for example)

# debug with qemu 
port 12345: 
qemu-arm -g 12345 -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/  main 

and in another terminal:
> gdb-multiarch
set $ROOT=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ # its better to use the root of the filesystem, if its a firmware
set solib-absolute-prefix $ROOT
set sysroot $ROOT
set solib-search-path $ROOT
target remote 127.0.0.1:12345
#break on every library load until you get your binary loaded, otherwise you will gonna need to break on a specific symbol
#which is a problem if there are no symbols at all
set stop-on-solib-events 1
