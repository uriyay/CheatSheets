### Simple Operators
multiple (dot) - \bullet
multiple (X) - \times
not equal (!=) - /=

### Special symbols
Infinity - \infty
lambda - \lambda
gamma - \gamma (works also for other greek letters)
fancy epsilon - \varepsilon (comparing to \epsilon which is the less fancy)

### Infi math
limit - lim_(n->\infty)
summation - \sum_(n=1)^(\infty)

### Groups Theory
x belongs to A - x \in A
union - \cup
intersection - \cap

### Integrals
integral - \int_(bottom)^(upper) (function)
integral calc line (|) - |_(bottom)^(upper)

### LaTex symobols
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8#:~:text=To%20insert%20an%20equation%20using,of%20math%20regions%20check%20box.
The idea is that you can move to LaTex in the middle of the equation, and then convert it to an equation.
It won't work like the MS Word Equation - its not converted automatically to equation as soon as you press the space bar, so you always need to convert it using the convert button.

### Newton's Binomial
There is no way to do it without LaTex
So first insert the LaTex syntax:
{n\choose k}
And then convert it using the Convert button, as said in the LaTex section
